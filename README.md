# KISK Scrapbook

[Scrapbook (scrapbook.kisk.cz)](https://scrapbook.kisk.cz/) is the place where we share our learning journey.
The goal of the scrapbook is to create a place where we will enjoy coming back to find
out what others are working on and support each other.

## Project structure

The project is a monorepo containing following workspaces:

apps:

- [site](./apps/site) - Next.js app for the public website
